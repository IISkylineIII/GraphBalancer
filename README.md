# GraphBalancer

# Description
GraphBalancer is a Python script that calculates the minimum number of edges needed to make a directed graph Eulerian-balanced — that is, a graph where each node has equal in-degree and out-degree. This is a key step in problems involving Eulerian paths and Eulerian circuits, commonly used in network design, bioinformatics (e.g., genome assembly), and graph theory.


# Functionality
min_edges_to_balance(graph)
Purpose:
Determines how many additional directed edges are needed to balance all nodes of a graph.

# Approach:

* Computes the in-degree and out-degree of each node.
* Calculates the absolute difference between these values for each node.
* Returns the total number of extra edges required to balance the graph.

# Parameters
graph (dict): A directed graph represented as an adjacency list (e.g., {1: [2, 3], 2: [4]}).

# Returns
int: Minimum number of edges needed to make the graph Eulerian-balanced.

# Example Usage
```
# Define a directed graph as an adjacency list
graph = {
    1: [2, 3, 5],
    2: [4],
    3: [2, 5],
    4: [1, 2, 5],
    5: [3]
}

# Compute and display the result
min_edges = min_edges_to_balance(graph)
print("Minimum number of edges needed:", min_edges)

```
# Output Example

* Minimum number of edges needed: 4

# Applications

This function is relevant to various applications in:

* Eulerian Path Algorithms: Balancing a graph before finding Eulerian trails.
* Bioinformatics: Used in De Bruijn graphs for genome assembly and sequence reconstruction.
* Network Routing: Ensuring data flow consistency in communication or transportation networks.
* Graph Theory Education: A clear example of degree balance concepts.

# Requirements

* Python 3.x
* No external libraries required.
